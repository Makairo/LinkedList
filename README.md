# 🔗 LinkedList

A simple **singly linked list implementation in C#** demonstrating fundamental data structure design and core list operations.

This repository contains a custom implementation of a linked list built from scratch to reinforce understanding of dynamic data structures and reference-based memory management in C#.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created to:

- Practice implementing a core data structure manually
- Understand references and node linking in C#
- Reinforce traversal, insertion, and deletion logic
- Demonstrate data structure fundamentals without relying on built-in collections

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Node creation and insertion  
✔ Node removal  
✔ List traversal and search  
✔ Edge-case handling (empty list, single node)
